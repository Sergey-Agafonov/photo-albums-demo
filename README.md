# Photo albums demo app by Sergey Agafonov (stack used: React/React Router/Vite/Jest/Bootstrap)

You will need Node to run locally. The app leverages free "{JSON} Placeholder" REST APIs.

It demonstrates the upgrade of a legacy 2021 React 17 app (originally built with "react-scripts") to React 18, now using Vite. Additionally, it contains a quite rudimentary "authentication/authorization" mechanism.

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
